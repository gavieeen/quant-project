This can just be a file we use for instructions and things we need to remember for this project:

1. When you clone repo, to enter venv run this command in terminal:
$ source venv/bin/activate

2. To download all dependencies from project run:
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you have python3 instead of python, use pip3

3. Anytime you install a new dependency or library to the venv, run:

(venv) $ pip freeze > requirements.txt

This will auto overwrite or current requirements.txt file

4. When we want to push some changes we've made but don't want to overwrite origin main:

(venv) $ git stash

To just save you changes locally

or

(venv) $ git checkout -b <new-branch-name-that-doesn't-have-spaces-in-it>
(venv) $ git push origin <new-branch-name-that-doesn't-have-spaces-in-it>
